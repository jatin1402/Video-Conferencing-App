Have you ever wanted to add Video Calling into your app? But thought it was too complex and time-consuming?

This is an enterprise-ready project design to integrate video and audio experience into any app in just few hours, yes, not weeks, not days.

This project can scale to millions of users and thousands of call participants. Moreover this project is capable of hosting 300 million meetings everyday.

For the development, I am using the latest technologies out there, from "Typescript" to "NextJS 14", including "tailwind css" and "shadcn" for moredern sleek styling.

The Third-party tools which helped me accomplish this project are "Clerk" for authentication and "Stream" for implementing video and audio features.
